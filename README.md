# Iris-Dataset

What i have learnt

- Split dataset into training and test set using model_selection.train_test_split()
- Visualize all variables using scatter_matrix
- Explore distribution of classes using df.groupby(by='class').size()
- Building models and compare their result average and std --> choose the best model
- Harness learning with 10 fold cross validation using model_selection.KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=seed)
- Measure the accuracy of model prediction outcome using metrics.accuracy_score. Also by using classifiication_report and confusion_matrix
- Apply model into predicting future observation
